;;; Commentary:

;; Some functions prompt by calling y-or-n-p or yes-or-no-p. It is
;; sometimes desirable to give the answer to the prompt from lisp.

;; One way to do this is to push an event (corresponding to the
;; keypress) onto `unread-command-events`. Another way is to advice
;; the prompting function to bypass the prompt. This package does the
;; latter.

;; Example usage:
;; (let ((auto-answer '(("\\`What's your name\\? \\'" "jack")
;;                      ("\\`What's your password\\? \\'" "secr3t"))))
;;   (list
;;    (read-string "What's your name? ")
;;    (read-passwd "What's your password? ")))
;; => ("jack" "secr3t")

(defvar auto-answer nil
  "When bound, prompting functions will not prompt.

This variable should be bound to a list of elements of the
form (REGEXP ANSWER).

If a prompt string, i.e. the first argument of one of the
function in `auto-answer-functions', matches REGEXP, then that
function will return ANSWER without prompting.")
